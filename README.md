# Computing periodic points of Veech surfaces

This repository, particularly the `samsurf` folder, contains an algorithm that can be used to compute the periodic points of particular Veech surfaces.  

At the present moment, the program works for Veech surfaces that are both vertically and horizontally periodic.
